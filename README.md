### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ It's Emmeline

## About me
I am an Integration engineer and a few months ago, I decided to dive into the DevOps and Cloud worlds.
I am currently learning Amazon Web Services, Kubernetes, and Python.

## My Projects
I am currently building a serverless web application. I document this journey [here](https://dev.to/esuivant/series/26146).

I also hosted my [personal web page](https://www.emmelinesuivant.com/#home) on AWS.
